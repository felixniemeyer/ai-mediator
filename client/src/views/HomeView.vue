  <h1>AI mediator for a better world</h1>
  <p>
    N people describe their perspective on a conflict to the AI. The AI analyzes
    the situation and then generates a helpful message for each person. Both the
    description and the message are only visible to the respective person.
  </p>
  <p>
    E.g. couples can use this to resolve conflicts and improve their
    relationship.
